                    <img src="portfolio/advocacy%20poster.png" alt="advocacy poster" id="advocacy">
                    <p>This was made in Photoshop for a graphic design project. <br> I'm fond of simplistic imagery, and for pushing an urgent message, the style works wonders.<br> I made the hospital graphic myself, and the QR code is functional as well. <br> It redirects you to Google and searches for hospitals near you. </p>

                <div id="albumcover">
                    <img src="portfolio/Album%20Cover-02-02.jpg" alt="album" id="album">
                    <p>This was one of my first Illustrator projects. I was tasked with re-making a pre-existing album cover. <br> I chose to remake the "Scaled and Icy" cover. It's an album from my favorite band, Twenty One Pilots, <br>whom I listen to a lot whilst I work on my pieces.</p>

                <div id="augustcat">
                    <img src="portfolio/august.png" alt="august cat" id="august">
                    <p>I made this in Photoshop for a class a few years back. I forgot what the assignment was, but this was labeled "August". <br> The cat is a character I made and draw a lot; I tend to use it to express myself and the emotions I internalize.<br> The cat is nearly, if not, a ten year old creation at this point that I'm very proud of.</p>

                <div id="flowerfinal">
                    <img src="portfolio/final.jpg" alt="flower final" id="flower">
                    <p>This was a relatively recent project made in Photoshop for a class.<br> Inspired by Sleeping Beauty, I donned one of my old dance costumes, set up the scene myself, then took my picture.<br> I then took the image to Photoshop and went wild with effects. I didn't expect it to come out as well as it did, but I'm proud of it.</p>

                <div id="heroncover">
                    <img src="portfolio/heron.jpg" alt="heron cover" id="heron">
                    <p>This was the May 2024 Heron cover. I placed the borders and text using InDesign.<br> At first, I had drop shadows and more gradients, but for printing reasons, those had to be removed.<br> Regardless, I'm happy with how it came out! It's so strange seeing its picture pop up here and there knowing I assembled it.</p>

                <div id="septembercat">
                    <img src="portfolio/september.png" alt="september cat" id="september">
                    <p>I don't remember when I made this, just like the August project. This was also made in Photoshop for the same assignment.<br> I chose this one as well to display because I admire how dedicated I was to truly immersing my character into each image,<Br> going so far as to add a sense of perspective into the mix.</p>

                <div id="redphotograph">
                    <img src="portfolio/siete.jpg" alt="red photograph" id="photo">
                    <p>Made with my father's camera and the power of Photoshop,<br> this has to be one of my favorite photography products I've made. I always love leaving imagery such as this up to audience interpretation,<br> as it can be so much more impactful that way. I think that aspect of this piece is what truly makes it special to me.</p>
