            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <div class="aboutme">
                <div class="abouttext">
                    <p>I've had a passion for all forms of art since I was a child. I used to play instruments, I've drawn in all sorts of mediums since I was young, and I've been a dancer for eleven years. It's been an amazing journey, and one I've learned much from.</p>

                    <p>Only recently did I start delving into my interests. My high school offered a few classes on Adobe products, the most notable being Photoshop. I took to the program immediately and have been using it since. A few years and several courses later, I've gathered a solid grasp of Photoshop and other Adobe products, namely Illustrator and InDesign.</p>
   
                    <p>Being able to make art in so many ways is impactful to me due to how my body is built. I am prone to injury, and thus, have been pulled away from expressing myself and my emotions in a physical manner many times. Turning to a pencil and paper in these times has helped me in more ways than one. Not only do I get to improve my skills, but I get to have fun doing it as well.</p>

                    <p>While I'm uncertain of what my future holds, I can only hope it's bright. I can see that I have potential to do great things with what I create. I just need to take the steps and reach for success.</p>
